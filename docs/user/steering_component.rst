==================
Steering component
==================

This model component is responsible for the integration of both the spatial
information (which elements are present in the surroundings? how strong are the
affinities in the different directions?) and the biophysical properties of the
neurite (the rigidity of the microtubule shaft...).
It is used together with the :ref:`extension-component` and the
:ref:`direction-component` to provide a complete model for the growth cone
elongation and navigation.

To understand how the spatial information (the affinity of each filopodia for
the substrate below it) is computed before being passed to the growth cone,
see :ref:`env_geom`.

Taking both information into account, the steering component computes the
probability of each direction to be selected for the next step.

The steering component can be one of the following implementations.

Pull-only
=========

This implementation only takes the spatial information into account: the
direction probability is directly proportional to the affinity of the filopodia
for what it is currently in contact with.

Thus for each filopodia :math:`i`, the probability of going in its direction
:math:`\theta_i`, given that is has an affinity :math:`a_i` for the substrate
beneath it is given by:

.. math::

    P(\theta_i) = \frac{a_i}{\sum_j a_j}

For the detailed implementation, see
:cpp:class:`growth::PullOnlySteeringModel`.


Memory-based
============

This algorithm is a variant of the one used by NETMORPH [Koene2009]_.
In this model, the previous direction of the growth cone is stored in a memory
variable :math:`\theta^{(m)}` and the rigidity of the microtubule shaft in that
direction imposes a bias towards it.

Thus, the probability of stepping into each of the filopodia is modified into

.. math::

    P(\theta_i) = \frac{a_i + r_f \cos\left(\theta_i - \theta^{(m)}\right)}
                  {\sum_j a_j + r_f \cos\left(\theta_i - \theta^{(m)}\right)}

where :math:`r_f` is the rigidity factor modeling the effect of the microtubule
shaft, which can be changed in |name| using the ``rigidity_factor`` argument.

For the detailed implementation, see
:cpp:class:`growth::MemBasedSteeringModel`.


Self-referential forces
=======================

This last scheme reproduces the algorithm developed in [Memelli2013]_ and
implemented in [Torben-Nielsen2014]_, where the objects sensed by the growth
cone, as well as the rigidity of the shaft, are modeled by "forces" acting on
the growth cone.

The implementation provided in |name| consists in a modified version of this
algorithm which corrects some error-prone mechanisms present in the original
scheme.
