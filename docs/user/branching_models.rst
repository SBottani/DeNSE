Branching Models
================

DeNSE implements two models for neurite branching, both inspired by experimental observations.
The first is growth cone splitting, which is widely observed in first stage of neurite outgrowth, while the second is related to lateral branching, or shaft branching, which happens in later stages of neurite growth.
Both the model has to be activated, default they are inactive.
