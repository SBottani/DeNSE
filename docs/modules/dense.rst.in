This page provides an overview of the |name| package.

For more information on the installation procedure, please see :ref:`install`.

We suggest starting with the @TODO TUTORIAL, before coming back to this page.
Once you are familiar with the basic function of |name|, additional details
can be found on the following pages:

* :ref:`units`
* :ref:`pymodels`
* :ref:`env_geom`

Though the core of the simulator is written in C++ for efficiency, all relevant
functions to create, configure and inspect objects are coded in python for
convenience.
